<!-- API v/s REST API v/s Web API v/s SOAP -->
<!-- REST API : Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface -->
<!-- Web API : Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. -->
<!-- SOAP : Simple Object Access Protocol : it is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services. -->
 <!-- REST API : Representational State Transfer API : it is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. -->
  <!-- Final objective of any API is to enable seamless communication between different software systems.
   with reference Full stack application API helps us in connecting the frontend with the backend services, 
   allowing for data exchange and functionality integration. -->
<!-- REST API uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. -->
<!-- REST API typically returns data in JSON or XML format, making it easy for different systems to parse and understand the data. -->
<!-- REST API is stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. -->
<!-- Why API is future of software development? ans how it is being replaced via AI Agents  -->
<!-- REST API is designed to be scalable and can handle a large number of requests from multiple clients simultaneously. -->
